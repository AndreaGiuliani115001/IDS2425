# IDS2425

The platform for the valorization and digitalization of agricultural products in a municipal territory through the uploading of information related to the agricultural supply chain, including data on production, transformation, and sale of local products. The platform will serve as a tool for promoting the territory, allowing users to understand the origin and quality of typical products. Additionally, it will facilitate the organization of local events, such as fairs and guided tours of farms.
